this should be easy to test.
./manage.py dumpdata > working.json
took 1 second to run for Ozake, not a huge hit for once a day
The basic theory is that backups are made when the page is loaded (depending on admin prefs), and downloaded every time the site is synced.
We are going to benefit by rewriting the sync script to add a lite mode, only download or upload one file (would be nice to add dependencies in Links and Fonts at some point)
not: models.py/admin.py:
setting for interval between backups
which backups to make: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year
total number of backups to keep in stock (if smaller than prev. set to prev.)
better just to configure the program, just have interval (manik could be weekly, staffeur monthly etc.)
make a backup every day & 1/7 of the time don't replace – it make it older
when it's a week old it , ¼ of the time don't replace, let it age
when that one's a month old, ⅓ of the time don't replace, let it age
when that one's three months old, ¼ of the time don't replace, let it age
views.py:
when page is loaded, check if a restore is called for (either in settings, restore on next visit, or because a restore db is present
if there's a restore programmed, do it (adding comment in source code?)
don't forget to run the postgresql script or try --natural to get rid of problem data
if there's not a restore programmed, check dump interval
if the most recent dump in /backups/ is not within the interval
create a dump in/backups/
delete databases that don't meet the "keep" requirement*
sync script:
if sync up or sync down:
do not touch anything in the /SYNC/backups folder
sync the backups folder down
also allow sync up only new for colleagues working on project
also allow sync down by filename for colleagues working on project
possible to not download backups (might take a long time if there are many)
lite mode for working on one page
restore:
from admin page?
upload a file, would be best
restore on next visit from [filename]
if you upload a fresh db in SYNC folder (not in sub folder)
it will automatically replace the existing site (with backup made of existing)
call files backup.svj
views don't get called when cached… need to make sure that cache is emptied frequently enough to generate dumps
backups are in root folder like SYNC, not in same folder as SYNC
