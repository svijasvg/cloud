when page loads, in SVG, replace image reference:
Links/home-hero-DSC_0020.jpg 
with image width & resolution info
treated/home-hero-DSC_0020-1680X20Q75D [day, second].jpg
need parameters in admin/responsive for image quality & size
page width = 1680
pixel size = 20x (skip decimal, 20 = 2)
quality = 0-100
if Image is missing, go get original image and create correct size & quality
models.py › responsive
image resolution compared to SVG width (2x, etc.) 2-digit integer
image quality (0-100)
admin.py › responsive
image resolution compared to SVG width (2x, etc.)
image quality (0-100)
views.py, when image is requested:
check that referrer is site not hacker
check uploaded image to get modified date
check in /cached-images/ to see if appropriate image exists with correct date
if it exists: use it
else: treat the image then return the new image
delete same image with wrong date
need a way to clear image cache : page view URL with check for admin?
need a way to exempt an image (just name it _x ?) so that overriding is possible
