### Adobe Fonts

So, I will add an Adobe font to the home page at svija.dev.

1. go to Character panel, click in font field
2. click **Find More** and wait for it to intialize
3. activate Acier BAT / text gris (click on cloud)
4. cloud w/ double arrow means "activating"

Activation takes a long time — possibly because iPad is downloading iOS 16.1 ?

Oops, I had deactivated the CC app on startup :-(

CC says installed, I try to reinstall and it takes a looooong time.

I quit AI and restart *au cas où*.

Looking at https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/kb/troubleshoot-font-activation.html

restarting computer & router fixed everything

font is installed, and on the home page.
